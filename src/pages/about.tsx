                        <p>
                            Growing up in the Salt Lake area, I have always been a lover of the outdoors. I spent my childhood and teenage years skiing, hiking, mountain biking,
                            and doing anything I could outside. After graduating High School, I served a religous mission in Riverside, California and CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. I became and still
                            am fluent in Spanish. My love for tech began at about 20 years old when I took a coding bootcamp - Dev Mountain. There, I found a passion for software engineering.

                        <p>
                            I recently have gotten married, and love spending time with my wife, Kylie. I am finishing up an Associates Degree at Salt Lake Community College, taking various
                            Computer Science classes. I'm currently employed at Monolith Brands Group as a Fullstack Software Engineer. My responsibilites, to name a few, include maintaining previously
                            built software to the company's needs, while developing new software to help various departments of the company.

                            Upon finishing at Salt Lake Community College, I plan on attending Utah Valley University to study Computer Science. I look forward to expanding my experience as a Software Engineer.
                            Constant learning is something that I love and am passionate about. I'm excited to see what my career will entail, the people I will meet, and the projects that I will be able
                            to contribute to in the upcoming years
